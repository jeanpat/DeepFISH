# DeepFISH
Why Deep? Because of deep-learning.

Why FISH? Because of **F**luorescent **i**n-**s**itu **H**ybridization.

This repository is intended to share data and code for resolving some problems met in cytogenetics imaging such overlapping chromosomes.

## Problem description

   In cytogenetics, experiments typically starts from chromosomal preparations fixed on glass slides. Occasionally a chromosome can fall on another one, yielding overlapping chromosomes in the image. Before computers and images processing with photography, chromosomes were cut from a paper picture and then classified (at least two paper pictures were required when chromosomes are overlapping). Automatic segmentation methods were developped to overcome this problem, however, these methods rely on a geometric analysis of the chromosome contour and require some human intervention when partial overlap occurs.
   
   The [QFISH on metaphase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-FISH) was classified as a [low-throughput method for quantitative analysis of the lenght of the telomeres](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3409675/figure/F1/) by Vera and Blasco. One of the botleneck of the method is the resolution of the the overlapping chromosomes. 
Modern deep-learning techniques have the potential to provide a more reliable, fully-automated solution.

## Libraries required to run this notebook:

This notebook is run from [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) with a python2 Kernel on a [Ubuntu 16.04 OS](https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop) inside a virtual environnement using the python packages available on the system. Several image processing libraries are used:

   * [mahotas](http://luispedro.org/software/mahotas/)
   * [opencv](http://opencv.org/)
   * [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
   * [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
   * [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/)
    
### Notebooks

Up to now, there's only python notebooks is to produce a dataset large enough to train a supervised learning algorithm (semantic segmentation) capable of segmenting overlapping chromosomes. The overlapping chromosomes generated, imply only two chromosomes (this is a start). They are obtained by varying the relative positions and orientations of the two chromosomes.

### Project stages
The first stage would to submit one dataset to a semantic segmentation algorithm such segnet. Different  implementations of **Segnet** are available in the current deep-learning frameworks:
     
* [theano+keras+python](https://github.com/pradyu1993/segnet/blob/master/segnet.py)
* [caffe + python](https://github.com/alexgkendall/caffe-segnet)
* [torch](https://github.com/yandex/segnet-torch)

The latter deep-learning framework is supposed to be more efficient than the segnet implementation:

* [Enet + torch + lua](https://github.com/e-lab/ENet-training).

### Dataset
   * **DAPI.tif and Cy3.tif** : 12 bits images of metaphasic chromosomes. The telomeres marking the end of the chromosomes are visible in the Cy3.tif image.The metaphase doesn't contain overlapping chromosomes.
   * **lowres_82146_overlapping_pairs_grey_DAPI-GroundTruth.h5** : 82146 pairs of low resolution (decreased by 4: the overlapping were generated from a DAPI image 16 times smaller than the original image).

   * **LowRes_13434_overlapping_pairs.h5** : 13434 pairs of overlapping chromosomes generated from the two previous images. This dataset is intended to train a supervised learning algorithm to resolve overlapping chromosomes. The dataset is stored as a numpy array and saved in a hdf5 file. Compared to the DAPI and Cy3 images,the resolution was decreased by two.
   * **overlapping_chromosomes_examples.h5**: smaller dataset (~2000 images). The resolution of the images is the same than the DAPI/Cy3 images.
   * **UltraSmall-COCO-Dataset_125_images-json.zip** a very small dataset with 125 images of overlapping chromosomes and their annotation file in COCO format generated online with makesense.ai
