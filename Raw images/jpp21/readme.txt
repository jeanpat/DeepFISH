jpp21 chromosomal preparations from male human lymphocytes (Jean-Patrick Pommier,unpublished results). Chromosomes were hybridized with a mix of telomeric PNA probe plus additionnal probes:

cy3 : (CCCTAA)3-pna probe
cy5 : additional oligo DNAprobe yielding a weak fluorescent signalon chromosomes 9.
fitc : oligo dna probe (fails)
DAPI : stains chromosomes.

Images were saved as  12 bits tiff images. The folder jpp21 contains 15 metaphases, metaphase 3 contains no chromosomal overlapping. The  chromosomes from this metaphase were used to prepare the dataset modelizing overlapping chromosomes.
